# SM_Week-5_Task-4

## Description
In this project, I linked 2 web pages with esp32 board that controls an LED through voice commands such as: open, close
to turn on LED or to turn off LED

The first web page is ( https://s-m.com.sa/r2/test/i.html ) which is responsible for detecting voice/ speech and converts it to written words (strings)
The second web page is (  https://s-m.com.sa/r2/test/retrieve.php  ) which is responsible for converting the string open and close to their numeric value 1 and 0 to be then used for later.

The LED responds to the voice command and either turns on or off
